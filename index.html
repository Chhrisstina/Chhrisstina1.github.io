 <h1>JUSTICE FOR ARMENIA</h1>
 <img src="./Image/kerkhof.jpg" alt="Armeense kerkhof">
 <p>The situation we have now in Armenia is terrible. Armenia is at war, an UNFAIR war.</p>
 <p>The Armenian city, Nagorno-Karabakh has become a ghost town. Houses of thousands of Armenians are destroyed. And everyone in the world is silent.</p>
<p>And to make the situation even worse, Azerbaijan has closed the only road transporting necessities. Karabakh is literally dying out.</p>
